# Hello , I'm Mateo :)
Welcome to my personal space! Here you'll find a bit about who I am, what I build, and what moves me.

ðŸ’» I'm a Computer Science student at ESPOL, passionate about Databases, Data Analysis. I'm also exploring how to apply AI toolsin real-world problems, and always looking to grow my skills in Mobile and Java Development.

ðŸ“· Outside of code, I love cinema and filmmaking â€” capturing stories and moments through a creative lens.
ðŸŽ§ Music is part of my daily life (Pink Floyd fan here), and Iâ€™m constantly inspired by the intersection of tech, art, and psychology.

Feel free to explore my work and connect!
